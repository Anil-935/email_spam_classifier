ðŸ“§ Email Scam Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based email scam detection system implemented in a Jupyter notebook. It classifies emails as **scam** or **non-scam** using natural language processing and classification algorithms.

ðŸš€ Project Features

- Preprocessing of email text data (stopword removal, tokenization, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

`email_scam_classifier.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook containing all code and analysis

ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk


Also, for NLTK:

python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')


ðŸ§  Model Workflow
